lazy_text\<open>
  For certain concepts like classes and class-types, only a generic
  definition for its resulting semantics can be given. Generic means,
  there is a function outside HOL that ``compiles'' a concrete,
  closed-world class diagram into a ``theory'' of this data model,
  consisting of a bunch of definitions for classes, accessors, method,
  casts, and tests for actual types, as well as proofs for the
  fundamental properties of these operations in this concrete data
  model.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Such generic function or ``compiler'' can be implemented in
  Isabelle on the ML level.  This has been done, for a semantics
  following the open-world assumption, for UML 2.0
  in~\cite{brucker.ea:extensible:2008-b, brucker:interactive:2007}. In
  this paper, we follow another approach for UML 2.4: we define the
  concepts of the compilation informally, and present a concrete
  example which is verified in Isabelle/HOL.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>We are presenting here a ``design-model'' of the (slightly
modified) example Figure 7.3, page 20 of
the OCL standard~\cite{omg:ocl:2012}. To be precise, this theory contains the formalization of
the data-part covered by the UML class model (see \autoref{fig:person}):\<close>

\<close>
lazy_text\<open>This means that the association (attached to the association class
\inlineocl{EmployeeRanking}) with the association ends \inlineocl+boss+ and \inlineocl+employees+ is implemented
by the attribute  \inlineocl+boss+ and the operation \inlineocl+employees+ (to be discussed in the OCL part
captured by the subsequent theory).
\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Ideally, the following is generated automatically from a UML class model.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Our data universe  consists in the concrete class diagram just of node's,
and implicitly of the class object. Each class implies the existence of a class
type defined for the corresponding object representations as follows:\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Now, we construct a concrete ``universe of OclAny types'' by injection into a
sum type containing the class types. This type of OclAny will be used as instance
for all respective type-variables.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Having fixed the object universe, we can introduce type synonyms that exactly correspond
to OCL types. Again, we exploit that our representation of OCL is a ``shallow embedding'' with a
one-to-one correspondance of OCL-types to types of the meta-language HOL.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Just a little check:\<close>
lazy_text\<open>To reuse key-elements of the library like referential equality, we have
to show that the object universe belongs to the type class ``oclany,'' \ie,
 each class type has to provide a function @{term oid_of} yielding the object id (oid) of the object.\<close>
lazy_text\<open>We instantiate the referential equality
on @{text "Person"} and @{text "OclAny"}\<close>
lazy_text\<open>For each Class \emph{C}, we will have a casting operation \inlineocl{.oclAsType($C$)},
   a test on the actual type \inlineocl{.oclIsTypeOf($C$)} as well as its relaxed form
   \inlineocl{.oclIsKindOf($C$)} (corresponding exactly to Java's \verb+instanceof+-operator.
\<close>
lazy_text\<open>Thus, since we have two class-types in our concrete class hierarchy, we have
two operations to declare and to provide two overloading definitions for the two static types.
\<close>
lazy_text\<open>To denote OCL-types occurring in OCL expressions syntactically---as, for example,  as
``argument'' of \inlineisar{oclAllInstances()}---we use the inverses of the injection
functions into the object universes; we show that this is sufficient ``characterization.''\<close>

the OCL standard~\cite{omg:ocl:2012}.
Here, analysis model means that associations
were really represented as relation on objects on the state---as is
intended by the standard---rather by pointers between objects as is
done in our ``design model'' (see \autoref{ex:employee-design:uml}).

an \verb+oid+ inside the class as ``pointer.''\<close>
lazy_text\<open>From there on, we can already define an empty state which must contain
for $\mathit{oid}_{Person}\mathcal{BOSS}$ the empty relation (encoded as association list, since there are
associations with a Sequence-like structure).\<close>
